Homepage: http://titelou.free.fr/wmbatppc

Installation:
=============

Unzip the source tarball:

	tar xvfz wmbatppc-1.0.tgz

move on to the fresh source directory:

	cd wmbatppc

then
	make

and install the program and manpage by

	make install


Running wmbatppc:
=================

To launch wmbatppc, the command is just

	wmbatppc 
	or 
	wmbatppc -w for WindowMaker/AfterStep/64*64 pix GUI

	or
	wmbatppc -x for (ximian) gnome app to swallow into the panel.

Use the command line option '-r <time in milliseconds>' to control the
frequency of sampling of the processes. Use -display and -geometry
options in the usual way.


Troubleshooting:
================

wmbatppc was tested with YellowDog Linux cs1.2 on a PowerBook 2000
(Pismo) and one battery (both bays).

If wmbatppc doesn't run, make sure that

1) your machine has the appropriate keylargo :-)

2) you have pmud daemon installed and running correctly on port 879.

3) in some case, you may have to restart pmud just after make install,
before launching wmbatppc. This occurs especially when upgrading wmbatppc.

Please report any bugs you might find to
